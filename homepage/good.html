                      <p>Welcome to my webpage! My name is Simon, and I am a computer science student at the University of Alberta. I have a strong interest in web development and machine learning. I have experience working with several programming languages, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. My experience comes from school courses such as CMPUT 404 (Where I made this website!) and internships where I was a web developer.</p>
                      <p class="mb-0">Throughout my studies, I have completed a variety of projects that have allowed me to hone my web development skills. I have worked on projects both independently and as part of a team. Some of my favorite projects include building an stock trading simulation site and recreating the game of Chinese Chess on Arduino.</p>

              <div class="col-lg-12">
                  <div class="row">
                      <div class="col-lg-12 mb-4 mb-sm-5">
                          <div>
                              <span class="section-title text-primary mb-3 mb-sm-4">Professional History</span>
                              <p>I have experience in academic research, where I worked on on a machine learning problem to automatically generate programs, and industry experience as a web developer gained from internship. During my academic research term, I worked under two professors specializing in algorithms and search. I worked on a python program to automatically generate good heuristics for use in search problems, such as puzzle, board games, and video games.</p>
                              <p class="mb-1-9">During my intership term, I worked in a team of software engineers to make a website displaying data from the company's recent efforts in the Internet of Things. Originally a hardware company, the new CEO decided to embrace current trends and look to upgrade their outdated infrastructure. I participated in that process by working on the centerpiece website, which connected the hardware devices and data with us and the clients.</p>

                            <span class="section-title text-primary mb-3 mb-sm-4">What I can offer</span>
                            <p>Programming skills: I have strong programming skills in languages like Javascript, Python, C++, and others that are relevant to the position.</p>
                            <p>Teamwork: I have the experience and ability to work well in a team, which is essential for completing complex projects and achieving shared goals.</p>
                            <p>Problem-solving skills: I can solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable tasks and then using algorithms and programming languages to create solutions.</p>
                            <p class="mb-1-9">Experience: I have a wide range of experience working in both academic research and industry production environments.</p>
